### Mapping Algorithm Approach

1. **Detect primary emotion** (highest confidence from ML model)
2. **Detect secondary emotions** (mix if multiple high confidence)
3. **Blend parameters** based on emotion intensity percentages
4. **Apply contextual modifiers** (genre, character, arc position)
5. **Generate alternatives** for user selection
6. **Provide rationale** with cinematography principles
7. **Include confidence scores** for all recommendations

### Database Schema Suggestion

```sql
CREATE TABLE emotion_profiles (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(20),
    color_data JSON,
    lighting_data JSON,
    camera_data JSON,
    reasoning_template TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE cinematography_rules (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    principle VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    visual_effect TEXT,
    emotional_associations JSON,
    citations TEXT
);
```
