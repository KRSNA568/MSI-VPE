Based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the MSI-VPE, here is a proposal for the User Interface design.

The design philosophy should be that of a "pro-app" (like Premiere Pro or Final Draft) in dark mode, focusing on dense data visualization and connecting textual input with visual output channels.

### High-Level Layout Strategy

The UI should be divided into three main vertical panes to facilitate the workflow of bridging "what is written" with "what is felt".

1. **Left Pane: The Source (Script Viewer)** - Displaying the raw input.
2. **Center Pane: The Bridge (Analysis Timeline)** - Visualizing emotional arcs, pacing, and segmentation.
3. **Right Pane: The Output (Intent Inspector & Controls)** - Displaying actionable technical metadata and style controls.

### Detailed UI Modules

#### 1. Global Top Bar (Navigation & Workflow)

* **Project Title:** e.g., "Project: Fade To Black (Draft 3)"
* 
**Workflow Stages Chevron:** A visual progress indicator showing the current step: `Upload > Analysis > Refinement > Export`.


* 
**Style Profile Selector:** A prominent dropdown menu to toggle "Visual Style" presets globally (e.g., "Select Preset: Noir," "High-Saturated Blockbuster," "Indie Realism").



#### 2. Left Pane: Script Ingestion & Viewer

* 
**Upload State (Empty State):** A drag-and-drop area accepting `.fdx` or `.pdf` files.


* **Viewer State (Populated):**
* A clean, industry-standard display of the screenplay text.
* **Interactive Highlighting:** As the user scrubs through the timeline in the center pane, the corresponding dialogue or action lines in the script viewer are highlighted.
* 
**Beat Markers:** Subtle visual indicators in the script margin showing where the engine has broken the script into smaller "Beats".





#### 3. Center Pane: Multimodal Timeline (The Core Engine)

This is the main visualization area for the "Narrative Subtext Extraction". It resembles a video editor's timeline but tracks emotion instead of video clips.

* 
**Header Track (Scene/Beat Segmentation):** A horizontal bar showing scene numbers and the smaller "Beats" within them.


* **Track A: Emotional Arc ("The Heatmap"):**
* A color-gradient visualization tracking the "heat" of the scene over time.


* 
*Visuals:* Areas of "Conflict" might glow red/yellow , while "Isolation" or "Melancholy" might be desaturated blue/teal.




* **Track B: Pacing Metadata (BPM):**
* A line graph showing cutting rates or "Beats Per Minute" derived from analyzing sentence length and verb density. Peaks indicate fast-paced action; valleys indicate slow contemplation.




* **Track C: Power Dynamics:**
* A segmented bar indicating which character "owns" the current beat, suggesting camera dominance.





#### 4. Right Pane: Intent Inspector & Technical Output

This pane shows the detailed "Scene Intent Schema (SIS)" data for whatever Beat is currently selected in the center timeline.

* **Header:** "Selected Beat Analysis [Timecode: 00:12:45]"
* **Module A: Primary Intent Tags:**
* Large, prominent tags summarizing the mood (e.g., `TENSION`, `INTIMACY`).
* 
*Human-in-the-loop feature:* An "Edit" button next to these tags allows the user to correct the AI if it missed nuances like sarcasm.




* **Module B: Visual Mapping Logic (The Technical Signals):**
These sections translate the intent into production terms.


* **Cinematography:**
* Suggested Lens/Focus: e.g., "Shallow Depth-of-Field" (derived from an "Intimacy" tag).


* Camera Angle Suggestion: e.g., "Low Angle (Character A Dominant)".




* **Lighting Quality:**
* Slider indicating "hardness" or "softness" of light based on mood.




* **Color Palette:**
* Swatches showing suggested color mapping (e.g., Harsh Yellows for conflict).






* **Module C: Generative Prompts:**
* A text field displaying auto-generated "Technical Tags" ready for downstream tools (e.g., `--lighting "Chiaroscuro" --camera "Handheld"`).





#### 5. Footer: Export Controls

* 
**Export Button:** A primary action button to generate the "Visual Planning Manifest".


* 
**Format Options:** Small selectors near the button for output format: `JSON`, `XML`, or `USD`.
